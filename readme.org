#+TITLE: Hexagen : A Hexaflexagon Generator
#+AUTHOR: Thomas Rometsch


* Description

A hexaflexagon is a strip of paper folded into a hexagonal shape.
It obviously shows two surfaces, but it also hides one or more
additional surfaces.

This is a generator to automatically make a template of a
hexahexafelxagon out of six hexagonal images ready for printing.
You only need to print the pdf, cut out the shape, fold it and glue it.

* Implementation details

The generator is implemented in HTML5 and Javascript.
It should run in almost every modern browser.
Computation is completly done on client side, so the page
can be downloaded an run locally.

* Code

This is an [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file and the final html file is [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-source-code.html][tangled]] from it.
